# Long_Exposure

Long exposure photography is really cool and popular nowadays. But not everyone has DSLR to capture one! Well, being a Computer Vision enthusiast, we can mimic one such shot to give silky smooth touch to the images by applying image/frame averaging.


Using OpenCV in python, we can process videos as a series of image frames. Just average all the frames in the video together and get the stunning long exposure esque images.
Make sure that the input video is time-lapse with static background and duration of atleast 10 seconds.
